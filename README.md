App name: Go Getters - Goal tracking and management

App description: The app provides a space whereby a person can record their travel memories in an easy to use format. After logging-in the user can see all of their travel posts showing the countries and cities they have visited. Each of these posts can then be further accessed to see all of the details, includung their journal notes.

Reason for app: I have always loved travelling and i love to record my memories from a trip in a journal to complie at home with pictures and souveniers. The app is the first step in allowing to do this in my phone without the need for a physical journal.
