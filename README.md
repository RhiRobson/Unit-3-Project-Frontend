App name: Go Getters - Goal tracking and management

App description: The app provides a secure site where the user can log into their accout to add and engage with goals. The user can log their goal along with infomration about their timeline and starting point. This goal can then be edited, updated or commented on by other users. Having the capability to recieve encouragement from toher users will help the user to be more motivated to achieve their goal.

Reason for app: I have recently started CrossFit and I have found the commmunity really encouraging, I felt that having a dedicated goal app, rather than traditional social media would be an interesting option for embracing the motivation, without having the distraction of other feeds and stories, would be helpful.

Attributions:

Notes from the GA unit 3 course were vital in building the app (https://generalassembly.instructure.com/login/canvas). In particular the Hoot demo project. <br>
https://stackoverflow.com/ I used stack overflow to research how to add the images via URL. <br>
https://canva.com to design the logo and edit the packgrounds for the different pages. <br>
https://youtube.com tutorials to help with the media formatting burger menu.  <br>
https://cloudinary.com tutorials and videos for image uploading - I didnt end up using this method, but I would if I created a user picture uploader, in my next steps. <br>
Technologies used: JavaScript, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, Postman, CSS <br>

Next steps:

- I would like to build in a file uploader element so that the user could upload thier own pictures, rather than having to use a URL.
- I would also like to be able to introduce levels into the user schema so that a user could join a training team and be able to share goals with specific contacs rather than into the whole app and all the users.
- I would also like the user to be able to archeive their goals once completed and then be able to view them on a archeive page. I didnt have time to do this in project week.
